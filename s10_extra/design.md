    *Machine learning engineering is 10% machine learning and 90% engineering.*

    Chip Huye, author of Designing Machine Learning Systems: An Iterative Process for Production-Ready Applications

Building machine learning systems is not just about training models and deploying them. The *success* of an ML system
depends heavily on its **design process** - how well you understand the problem, define the objectives and plan the
system architecture before writing a single line of code.

As ML engineers and practitioners, it's tempting to dive straight into the data and algorithms. However, failing to
think through the design can lead to systems that are brittle, inefficient or incapable of meeting real-work
requirements. Said in another way we want to minimize the amount of rework that we have to do and the overall
[technical debt](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2015/hash/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Abstract.html)
that we accumulate.

In addition, you are often not the only stakeholder in a ML project, which often includes data engineers, data
scientists, product managers, and business stakeholders. As such, having a clear design that can be easily communicated
to non-technical stakeholders is crucial. We are in this module going to look at what the design process could look
like. If you are more interested in this topic we recommend that you read the book
*Designing Machine Learning Systems: An Iterative Process for Production-Ready Applications* by Chip Huyen.

# The stack

Have you ever encountered the concept of **full stack developer**. A full stack developer is an developer who can
both develop client and server software or in more general terms, it is a developer who can take care of the complete
developer pipeline.

Below is seen an image of the massive amounts of tools that exist within the MLOps umbrella.

In this course we have chosen to make our own canvas, but it is highly inspired by
[Machine Learning Canvas](https://madewithml.com/static/templates/ml-canvas.pdf) from the
[Made with ML course](https://madewithml.com/) and the
[Machine Learning Canvas](https://www.ownml.co/machine-learning-canvas) by Louis Dorard.

!!! note "Editing the canvas"

    The canvas is made in [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), which I use for all my diagrams. You can easily begin
    editing the canvas by clicking
    [here](https://app.diagrams.net/?client=1#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FSkafteNicki%2Fdtu_mlops%2Fdesign%2Ffigures%2Fdiagrams%2Fmlops_canvas.drawio#%7B%22pageId%22%3A%22pnmmrmMmQEoPrk8f0Ppy%22%7D) which will open the web version of draw.io with the canvas loaded.

    treatment plans, and post-discharge follow-up information. Additional data sources include social determinants of
    health and patient feedback surveys.

    `Data Governance`
    : ABC Healthcare will implement robust data governance policies to ensure the quality, privacy, and security of
    patient data. Compliance with HIPAA and other relevant regulations will be strictly maintained, with controlled
    access to sensitive data.

    `Modelling`
    : The model will use logistic regression and random forests to predict readmission risk based on patient health
    data. Feature engineering will include factors like comorbidities, prior hospitalizations, discharge instructions,
    and follow-up adherence.

    `Metrics & Evaluation`
    : Model performance will be evaluated using metrics such as Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC), precision, recall,
    and F1 score. Additionally, the actual reduction in readmission rates and cost savings will be monitored to measure
    real-world impact.

    `Model Governance`
    : A multidisciplinary team will oversee model monitoring and maintenance. Regular updates and retraining will be
    performed to incorporate new patient data and medical insights, ensuring the model remains accurate and relevant.
